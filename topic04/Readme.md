Practice Lab: Model Evaluation and Interpretability



Objectives:

Cover various machine learning techniques, including linear regression, decision trees, logistic regression, and interpretability tools like Microsoft InterpretML, LIME, SHAP, and Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP). It helps you gain insights into model behavior and interpretability using the provided datasets.

Requirements:

Follow the training slide. Each section will have instructions for using the exercises. 

The section name is the same to the practice file name
